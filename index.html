    <section>
      <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
      <p>
        I am thrilled to apply for the Summer Internship Program at Paramount, an opportunity that aligns perfectly with my background in computer science and my passion for working in the dynamic intersection of technology and media. As a Master of Science in Computer Science student at Santa Clara University, I am drawn to Paramount’s innovative approach to creating premium content and experiences for global audiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        My academic and professional journey has equipped me with a blend of technical and project management skills that I believe will make me an asset to your team:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Project Management and Process Optimization:</strong> During my time at Fortinet, I worked on the FortiSOAR product, where I contributed to high-level project planning, task management, and risk identification within a microservices architecture. I also collaborated with cross-functional teams to streamline business processes, ensuring the delivery of high-quality features and bug fixes. My familiarity with Agile methodologies and tools like Jira positions me to excel in operational and project management roles at Paramount.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Technical Documentation and Communication:</strong> In addition to coding, I have prepared comprehensive documentation and help guides for projects, which played a key role in onboarding new team members and ensuring consistent project delivery. My ability to communicate complex technical ideas clearly aligns with the program’s emphasis on collaboration across multiple functional teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Technical Expertise:</strong> My hands-on experience includes full-stack development, API integration, and technology application testing. At Fortinet, I utilized programming languages like Java, Python, and JavaScript, frameworks like ReactJS and Spring Boot, and tools such as Git and Google Suite, all of which have honed my technical proficiency and problem-solving abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Creative and Analytical Thinking:</strong> While pursuing my PG-Diploma in Advanced Computing at CDAC Pune, I tackled challenges such as designing scalable databases and deciding between monolithic and microservices architectures for our movie ticket booking app. These experiences have instilled in me a robust analytical mindset, which I am eager to bring to Paramount’s technology projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paramount’s dedication to fostering creativity and collaboration resonates deeply with me, as does the opportunity to work on projects that influence culture and entertainment on a global scale. I am particularly excited about the prospect of contributing to your technology team’s innovation and operational success while learning from industry leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of bringing my skills, dedication, and passion to Paramount’s Summer Internship Program.
      </p>
      <p>Sincerely,<br>
        Yash Patodkar
